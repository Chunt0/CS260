# Final Assignment
So it's June 7th and I'm turning it in so far.

It was working really well until I tried to implement Kruskal's Minimum Spanning
Tree and then the remove functions broke. I'm going to try to fix it but the chemo
has been really rough and I'm having a hard time finding the energy.

This will be update when I fix the problem..

In driver.cpp you will see that I preconstruct a graph for you, I used the example
found on Geeks For Geeks - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/
From this you can test Dijkstra's Algorithm, just pick a source and destination and
you will get the shortest path. You can add and remove vertices and edges as you wish,
each time you run Dijkstra's algo it will recalculate all paths from a source from
the graph as it is at that moment. As far as the Minimum Spanning Tree is concerned,
all it does right now is print each edge's weight from smallest to largest that exist
in the graph. Play around with it and try to break it! I'm sure you can!
