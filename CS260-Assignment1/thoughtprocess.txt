Assignment 1 - Bag O' Marbles 
=============================


[*] Take One [*]
----------------

For this assignment I am going to create two classes

Class 1: Marble --> attributes: color and material
Class 2: Bag --> attributes: color, size, number of marbles in bag, marbles in bag

The marble class will have two data types, color and material. This will be able to
be set and retrieved.

The bag class will also have two data types, the size of the bag, the number of marbles in the bag and
some type of data structure that will hold the marbles that are "put" or "removed" from
the bag.

--------------------------------

[*] Take Two [*]
----------------

After doing some reading on ADT (abstract data types) it seems like in order 
to make something dynamic I'm going to need to build a "Linked List"

So I'm going to reduce my classes to just one.

The Linked List Model will be a List class that contains a "Node" struct 
called Marble.

There will be Marble* in the class that will be used to construct and perform
various functions on the List.


Design
======

class List:
    attribute:
        struct Marble  
            int id, string color, Marble* next
        Marble* head, current, temp
        int num_of_marbles, id

    methods:
        constructor/destructor
        add
        removed
        print
        number of marbles
        selection selectionLoop
