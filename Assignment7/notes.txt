Hash Table -> maps KEYs to VALUEs using a HASH FUNCTION to compute an INDEX (or 
HASH CODE) into an array of BUCKETS or SLOTS.

When doing a look up the KEY is hashed and that hash indicates where the VALUE is
stored in memory.

Most hash functions are imperfect and there is a possibility that two different
KEYs return the same INDEX

Hash Tables are great because average time complexity is O(1) for search, insert,
and delete.
