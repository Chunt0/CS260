PyList Design
================
A PyList is my attempt at reproducing a python list object in C++

At the moment my design is utilizing the same attributes as a traditional Linked List,
but the foundational methods are taken from Python's list object's methods.
There are 11 different python list methods, those with a star I intend on completeing,
while those without might have to be after thoughts. 

class PyList:
    attributes:
        struct node
            value, next*
        node* head, current, temp
        int size

    Methods:
        *constructor ~
        *destructor ~
        *append ~
        *count ~
        *index ~
        *insert ~
        *pop ~
        *remove ~
        clear
        copy
        extend
        reverse
        sort
