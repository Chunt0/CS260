# Assignment 6

For this assignment please proceed to the folder SimpleBinaryTree.
This folder contains all source code for my simple Binary Search Tree.

The bulk of the work is in bin_tree.cpp where I implemented the actual data structure.
You will find insert and remove functions, as well as several different printing options
for in order, pre order, and post order traversals.

The destructor utilizes post order traversal to move from the leaves of the tree,
deleting there way up to the root.
